# ASP.NET Core Web API – Clean Architecture

## Overview
This project is an enterprise-style ASP.NET Core Web API built using Clean Architecture principles.  
The application demonstrates how to design scalable, maintainable, and testable backend systems following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

It focuses on clear separation of concerns between application layers, proper handling of business logic, and database-driven development.

## Tech Stack
- C#
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL
- RESTful Services
- Git

## Key Features
- Layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- RESTful API design
- Database integration using Entity Framework Core
- Clean separation of business logic and data access
- Follows SDLC phases: design, development, testing, and maintenance
- Git-based version control

## What I Learned
- Building enterprise-grade backend applications in ASP.NET Core
- Applying Clean Architecture for long-term maintainability
- Designing REST APIs with proper layering
- Working with relational databases using EF Core
- Understanding real-world backend workflows

## Use Case
This project simulates how internal enterprise systems are built and maintained in organizations, similar to business applications used in healthcare and research environments.
